# Model deployment in Java
This repository is meant to show how to use the new ONNX Java Presets to load models. Currently, unfortunately there is
no backend to run models in Java. Therefore, only the graph can be loaded but no predictions can be performed. For
this purpose I'm incorporating JEP to actually run models.
